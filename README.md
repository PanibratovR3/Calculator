# Calculator

Web version of calculator for performing basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.

For implementation of this app next tools were used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

If you need to remove number from input field, press _Backspace_.

In this project I learned to apply methods for working with arrays (storing numbers and operators) and objects (using it as a memory of app for two operands, current and previous opeator).
